# Air Pollution Assignment Part #3
# Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases 
# and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where 
# the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold. 
# The function should return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. 
# If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0. 
# For this function you will need to use the 'cor' function in R which calculates 
# the correlation between two vectors.

      ## the location of the CSV file
      
      ## 'threshold' is a numeric vector of length 1 indicating
      ## the number of completely obsersved observations (on all variables)
      ## required to compute the correlation between nigrate and sulfate;
      ## the default is 0
      
      ## Return a numeric vector of correlations
